        "3.\tAuditors at a small community bank randomly sample 100 withdrawal transactions made during the week at an ATM machine located near the bankâ€™s main branch. Over the past 2 years, the average withdrawal amount has been 50 dollar with a standard deviation of 40 dollar. Since audit investigations are typically expensive, the auditors decide to not initiate further investigations if the mean transaction amount of the sample is between $45 and $55. What is the probability that in any given week, there will be an investigation?"
